# Securing Content Integrity: On-Chain Deepfake Detection & Originality Verification for Social Media 

## üìå Problem Statement
In today's digital age, deepfake images and videos present a significant threat to both personal and public integrity. These highly sophisticated AI-generated media can depict individuals in scenarios they have never been involved in, leading to potential reputational damage, false accusations, and even legal issues. This creates a critical need for a robust, transparent, and tamper-proof solution to identify and flag deepfakes before they cause irreparable harm.

Key challenges include:

- Deepfake Threats to Integrity: Individuals‚Äô reputations can be irreparably damaged by false media that show them doing things they have never done.

- Lack of Trust in Media: As deepfakes grow more convincing, it becomes increasingly difficult to trust visual media, raising concerns about the validity of content.

- Image Theft and Unauthorized Usage: Content creators often face issues with image theft, where their original content is reposted without permission.

- Complex Reporting Process: Existing mechanisms for reporting deepfakes and unoriginal content are slow and prone to errors, further complicating the fight against misinformation.

## ‚úÖ Vision
Our vision is to provide a solution that protects both individuals and content creators from the dangers of deepfakes and image theft. By utilizing on-chain AI deepfake detection and originality verification, the platform aims to:

-Safeguard personal integrity by ensuring that deepfake media can be flagged and verified quickly.

-Support content creators in defending their original works from theft and reposting.

-Ensure trust in media through a transparent, decentralized verification system that guarantees content integrity.

By leveraging blockchain technology for tamper-proof verification and multichain compatibility (eg. Manta, Scroll, ICP), we aim to create a safer online environment where users can interact with verified, original content without the fear of being deceived by false media.

## üåü Unique Value Proposition
The unique combination of on-chain AI-powered deepfake detection and originality verification ensures that:

- Personal Integrity is Protected: Deepfake detection allows individuals to safeguard their reputation through tagging manipulated images in real-time.

- Sybil Resistance: World ID verification prevents Sybil attacks, where a user creates multiple fake identities. This ensures that a single verified individual cannot create multiple accounts to upload misleading content.
  
- Transparency is Guaranteed: Once deepfake or originality checks are performed, the results are stored immutably on the blockchain, providing an unalterable record.
  
- Cross-Chain Compatibility: The toolkit operates across and supports all EVM blockchains, making it scalable and applicable to a wide array of social media platforms.
  
- Prevention of Image Theft: Content creators can use the originality verification tool to ensure their images aren‚Äôt stolen or reposted without their permission.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It‚Äôs Made
This project uses cutting-edge blockchain and AI technology to detect deepfake images and verify the originality of visual content:

- On-Chain AI Model: An AI-powered deepfake detection model is deployed on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to analyze and classify deepfake images. The deepfake score (deepfakeValue) is stored immutably on the blockchain.
  
- Originality Verification: A hash of the image is stored along with its originality status on-chain, ensuring that any reposted or stolen images can be detected and flagged immediately.
  
- Multichain Compatibility: The solution supports multiple blockchains, ensuring that media across platforms can be verified for authenticity.
